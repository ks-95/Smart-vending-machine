# 🛒 Smart Vending Machine System
**Architecting Modular, Extensible Systems with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a production-grade simulation of an automated retail system. Built with a focus on **Separation of Concerns (SoC)**, the system manages inventory, processes complex transactions, and handles error states in a modular environment. This serves as a foundation for integrating IoT hardware or digital payment gateways.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Methodology:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Key Patterns:** Encapsulation, Composition, and Modular Architecture

## 🏗 System Architecture
The system is divided into three core engines to ensure maintainability:
1. **Inventory Manager:** Handles real-time stock tracking, pricing logic, and "out-of-stock" protocols.
2. **Payment Processor:** A secure module for balance management, transaction validation, and payment state handling.
3. **Master Controller (VendingMachine):** The integration layer that coordinates communication between the Inventory and Payment modules.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Extensible Design:** The modular nature allows for easy integration of new features like UPI Payment APIs or temperature sensors.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Integrated logic to prevent transactions when stock is unavailable or balance is insufficient.
- **Clean Code Principles:** Adheres to Pythonic standards and OOP best practices, making the codebase ready for enterprise-level scaling.

## 📈 Engineering Impact
- **Modularity:** Demonstrated the ability to break down a complex physical process into discrete, reusable software components.
- **Scalability:** The architecture is designed to support thousands of machines with a centralized database backend if needed.
- **Career Focus:** Showcases the foundational software engineering skills required to build production-level AI and ML models.
